            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>All roads enevitably crack up over time, and require manual labour to fix. But how do we know which roads to fix?</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>With Road Crack™️, anyone can report broken roads, and vote on which roads to fix first. No longer do you need to know someone working in the gouvernment to get your local roads fixed.</p>
            <h2>Sustainable Development Goal</h2>
            <blockquote>UN SDG: 11 Sustainable cities and communities</blockquote>
            Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.<br>
            Road Marker; an app the user uses to mark places they’ve driven where the roads are broken (cracks etc). A heatmap of where most reports are given could be generated to help government officials decide where to do roadwork.
